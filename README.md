## GA4GH Genomic Knowledge Standards

The "Genomic Knowledge Standards" ([GKS](http://ga4gh-gks.github.io)) work stream is one of the elements of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ([GA4GH](http://ga4gh.org)), aimed at developing standard formats for the exchange of genomic data for research and biomedical applications.

The current focus of GKS lies in the evaluation and definitions of forward-looking formats and implementations for the representation and annotations of genomic variants.
